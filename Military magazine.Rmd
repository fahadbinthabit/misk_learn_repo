```{r echo = FALSE}


head(mimo[order(mimo$`Total Military Personnel`, decreasing=TRUE), ], 10) %>%
  select(Country,
         `Total Military Personnel`) %>% ggplot(aes(Country,`Total Military Personnel`)) + geom_col() + coord_flip()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
